# Problem Background


```{python}
from helpers import create_database_engine, run_sql_and_return_df, run_sql_and_return_html, create_db_wrapper, execute_ddl_from_file, execute_ddl

# Load these variables from .env file.
config_map = {
  'user': "CMSC408_HW8_USER",
  'password': "CMSC408_HW8_PASSWORD",
  'host': "CMSC408_HW8_HOST",
  'database': "CMSC408_HW8_DB_NAME"
}

cnx,config = create_db_wrapper( config_map )
  
```


```{python}
# Do a quick test of the connection and trap the errors better!

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  table_schema, table_name, table_rows
from
  information_schema.tables
where
  table_schema in ('world_bank_data')
""")

```

# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT `Country Name`
FROM wdi_country
WHERE `Region` IS NULL OR `Region` = ''
ORDER BY `Country Name`;
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;
drop table if exists peopleroles;
drop table if exists peopleskills;
drop table if exists roles;
drop table if exists people;
drop table if exists skills;
""")
```

```{python}
# create table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
CREATE table wdi_country as
select

 world_bank_data.wdi_country
where
  not region is NULL;
""")
```

```{python}
# show number of records
run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select count(*) from wdi_country
""")
```

## Task 5

According to the World Bank, in 2020 there were how many countries in the world?

```{python}
## (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select count(*) from wdi_country;
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  region
from
  wdi_country
group by
  region
order by

```

## Task 7

How many countries are in each region?

```{python}
## How many countries are in each region?
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  region,
  count(region) as "# Countries"
from
  wdi_country
group by
  region
order by
  region
""")

```

## Task 8

List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america.

```{python}
## List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  region,
  `Long Name`
from
  wdi_country

```

## Task 9

```{python}
## The last World Cup soccer tournament was hosted by Qatar.
## What region contains Qatar?  List the region, country short name and full name
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  region,
  `Short Name` ,
  `Long Name`
from
  wdi_country

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select `Country Code`, `Short Name`, `2-alpha code`, `WB-2 code`,`Region`
from wdi_country
where
 `2-alpha code` <> `WB-2 code`
""")

```

## Task 11

```{python}
## Now, let's investigate the "income category" field.
## List the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  `Income Group` ,

```

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  `Short Name`,
  region,
  `Income Group`

```

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

execute_ddl(cnx,"""
UPDATE wdi_country
SET `Income Group` = 'High income'

```

## Task 14

```{python}
## Write a single query that show the number of countries in each 
## "Region"-"Income Group" pair.  The table should have 3 columns:
## region, income group, and no.of.countries.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT
  region,
  `Income Group` AS income_group,

GROUP BY
  region, `Income Group`
ORDER BY
  region, `Income Group`;
""")

```

## Task 15

```{python}
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

```

## Task 16

```{python}
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query, order by, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

```

## Task 17

```{python}
## Are you getting the hand of this? Good! We need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  As a hint,
## the country code for the Marshall Islands is MHL.
## (skills: select, where, subquery)

## Task 18

```{python}
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)
## (skills: select, where, subqueries, joins)

## percentage tables.  For example, across the entire sample, what
## is the percentage of total countries in each income category?

## As a first step, build off the result from task 14 and create a table with
## six columns (region, income cat, country count, sum of countries in region,
## sum of countries by income and total sum countries).
##
## THEN, add a 7th column calculating the percent of total for each,

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

Throughout these exercises, I have learned more about basic SQL and I can say that I am much more confident. The operations have come easy now and I understand how to do it without much confusion. One skill that I still need more practice on is nest subqueries, especially using them in WHERE clauses and combining with joins. Overall, this assignment helped me use SQL syntax to real data problems and I am more comfortable writing queries without a lot of help and notes. 

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

For those three tasks, I tried to understand what exactly the question was asking and then thought about how to build it with SQL. Whenever I ran into any issues, I would test and troubleshoot small parts of the query to make sure that it was working properly before combining them. I also referred back to earlier tasks to see if there were any patterns or techniques I could reuse. In the future, I would approach similar problems by planning and breaking the problem into smaller, manageable steps before writing the SQL.

3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

This assignment showed me how useful SQL is for analyzing and transforming data. I understand how much more complex SQL can be and used to solve many different real-world problems. Another big takeaway that I got from this assignment was that SQL is not just used to pull and review data, but you can filter, reshape, and organize data for further analysis. I think these skills will apply for tasks, such as, identifying missing values, combining multiple tables, and grouping categories together for in-dept data anaylsis.
