# Creating source code for HW9


## Overview


This project focuses on SQL-based data exploration and transformation using a dataset, World Bank WDI (World Development Indicators) dataset. The dataset contains various indicators related to global development, including economic, social, and environmental data. The goal is to perform data exploration, transformation, and analysis using SQL queries.


# Tools and Technologies
- **MySQL**: The primary database management system used for data storage and querying.
- **Python**: Used for data manipulation and transformation tasks.
- **Pandas**: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis, particularly useful for handling tabular data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing and executing Python code, ideal for data exploration and analysis.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, used to interact with the MySQL database.


# Project Structure
- **.venv**: Virtual environment directory containing the Python environment and dependencies.
- **.vscode**: Visual Studio Code settings and configurations.
- **reports**: Directory for storing generated reports and visualizations.
- **source-data**: Directory containing the source data files and SQL scripts.


# Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Set Up MySQL Database**: Ensure you have a MySQL database set up and running. Create a database for the project.
5. **Load Data**: Load the provided CSV files into the MySQL database using the provided SQL scripts or Python scripts.
6. **Run SQL Queries**: Use the provided SQL scripts to perform data exploration and transformation tasks. You can execute these queries directly in MySQL or through Python using SQLAlchemy.
7. **Generate Reports**: Use Jupyter Notebook to generate reports and visualizations based on the SQL queries and data analysis performed.
